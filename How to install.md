# How to install
~~I'm so sorry~~


## Step one: Add the instance
So, you have to add an instance to your prefered launcher of choice. I personally use PrismLauncher and I know that most people have the curse launcher installed, but I'm going to guide through the process for the official launcher. The process should be largely the same any way you do it. First, add a new installation:

Then, you need to change a few more things:  
- Set the version to `relese 1.7.10`
- Set the JVM arguments to `-XX:+UseG1GC -Xmx4G -Xms4G -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=2147483646 -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=32M`
- Finally, launch the game once. You can close it as soon as it's at the main menu. Make sure the launcher also closes too. 


## Step three: Download and install forge
This is step should be not too bad, but a little difficult to get the first time. First, go to [the page for Forge 1.7.10 1614](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) and download the Latest or Recommended version of Forge, they're both the same. Then, run the jar that you've downloaded. There might be an issue if you haven't run the instance of Minecraft in 1.7.10 before. Otherwise, it'll take a minute and then give a success message.   


## Step four: Download the mods and config
This modpack uses mods that aren't availabe from curseforge. This means that you have to download the mods from github. This is probably illegal, but for me, not for you. Simply click the link to the zip folder on the most recent release on [this](https://github.com/DrKittyKat/mmodpack/releases) page. I'll update this page with mods and config files as I change it. Inside will be a `mods` folder and a `config` folder. Extract these two folders into the folder `%APPDATA%/.minecraft/`


## Step five: Play?
That should be everything to get the modpack working properly. Feel free to DM me with any issues.
