# Kitty's Nostalgia Modpack
Kitty's Nostalgia Modpack is a 1.7.10 based modpack with some of my favorite mods and some classic 1.7.10 mods. No balance changes have been made to any of the mods, the idea is to experience the mods as they are. Since some of these mods aren't available on other launchers, there's an installation guide linked [here](https://github.com/DrKittyKat/mmodpack/blob/main/How%20to%20install.md). Additionally, if you'd like a full list of mods with brief descriptions for each of them, you can view that page [here](https://github.com/DrKittyKat/mmodpack/blob/main/Kitty's%20Nostalgia%20Mod%20List.md). I hope you enjoy your time here! If you need any help, don't hesitate to reach out to me. My discord DMs are open at Dr_KittyKat with the tag #3461.
