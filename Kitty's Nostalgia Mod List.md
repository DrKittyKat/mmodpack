# All Mods  
[AbyssalCraft](https://abyssalcraft.fandom.com/wiki/AbyssalCraft_Wiki) is an exploration mod that provides Lovecraftian dimensions and biomes. Start by crafting a Necronomicon with rotten flesh, iron, and a book.  
[Aether II](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aether-ii) is a mod that adds a sky dimension. There are cows and pigs with wings, is there anything else you need? Make a portal made of glowstone, 'lit' with a bucket of water! I can also wholeheartedly recommend the [OST](https://emilevankrieken.bandcamp.com/album/the-aether-ii-original-soundtrack)  
[Archaic Fix](https://github.com/embeddedt/ArchaicFix) is a bunch of bug fixes for 1.7.10. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Atum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atum) is a mod that makes a desert dimension based kinda on ancient Egypt stuff. You need to craft a scarab with gold and diamond and to build a portal with sandstone and water.  
[BetterFps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterfps) is a mod that makes the FPS(frames per second) better. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[BiblioCraft](https://www.bibliocraftmod.com/) adds lots of fun decorative, lighting, and storage thingies! Check NEI for recipies.  
[BiblioWoods](https://www.bibliocraftmod.com/bibliowoods-addons/) provides BiblioCraft integration for Biomes O' Plenty, ExtraBiomesXL, and Natura.  
[Biomes O' Plenty](https://biomesoplenty.fandom.com/wiki/Biomes_O%27_Plenty_Wiki) makes exploring more fun with more biomes! In addition to more biomes, there are more plants, tree types, and blocks. There is no biome finder in this version, so get exploring!  
[Blood Magic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blood-magic) is a dark magic based off the blood of you and your enemies. To start, you're going to need to craft a blood altar with a diamond and gold and then use it to make a blood orb, but ~~the documentation for this old version of the mod no longer exists~~ the knowledge of this magic has been lost to time...  
**[Botania](https://botaniamod.net/index.html) is a magical science based off flowers. Start by putting a sapling and a book together and collecting the sixteen colors of mystical flowers!**  
[BuildCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/buildcraft) pipes and generators and machines oh my! There are also facades for basically every block, so good luck finding anything in NEI for it...  
[Chocolate Quest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cqrepoured) adds structures to discover when exploring and magic stuff I think. I only ever like exploring the structures, so I don't know all you can do with it!  
[CodeChicken Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/codechickencore) is a library mod required for NotEnoughItems. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[CoFH Core](https://teamcofh.com/) is a library mod required for Thermal Dynamics, Expansion, and Foundation. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[CoroUtil Library](https://coros.us/mods/coroutil) is a library mod required for TropiCraft. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Endless IDs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endlessids) is a mod that provides fixes for biome and dimension ids as well as patches for some of the mods I used. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Erebus](https://the-erebus.fandom.com/wiki/The_Erebus_Wiki) is a dimension with lots of bugs to meet and say hello to! Start by crafting an offering altar with stone bricks, obsidian, and gold. Then, offer an emerald, diamond, and obsidan. You may want to make two so you can make a staff to get there and a staff to get back. I don't like bugs very much, so I will not be spending much time here...  
**Eternal Frost (~~Good luck finding a link lol~~) is a snowy dimension, that I very much vibe with. This lost mod is only in 1.7.10! Start by crafting a flint and diamond then build a portal out of snowy obsidian. Are you ready to freeze to death in the frostfire?**  
[ExtrabiomesXL](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extrabiomesxl) is a 1.7.10 exclusive mod that includes lots of new biomes to explore! In my opinion, compared to Biomes O' Plenty, it's more impressive on a macro generation scale, but less interesting on a micro scale.  
[FalsePatternLib](https://github.com/FalsePattern/FalsePatternLib) is a library mod required for Endless IDs. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[FastCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastcraft) makes Minecraft perform better, in general, like FPS increase, TPS improvements, RAM savings, and more. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[FoamFix](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/foamfix-optimization-mod) is a mod with a funny name that makes use like half the memory it would otherwise. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
**[Galacticraft Core](https://wiki.micdoodle8.com/wiki/Galacticraft) asks have you ever wanted to go to space in Minecraft? No? Well now you can! The linked wiki is incredibly useful, but to start you need lots of underground resources, a circuit fabricator, and a compressor.**   
[Galacticraft Planets](https://wiki.micdoodle8.com/wiki/Galacticraft) Oh, you've already gone to the moon? Well now there are even more planets! Upgrade your ship and explore the rest of the solar system!  
[Guilded Games Util](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gilded-games-util?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=228114) is a library mod required for Aether II. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[IndustrialCraft 2](https://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Main_Page) adds complex mechanisms and nifty tools. Build a jetpack, create a miner, or maybe work your way to QuantumSuit armor so you can bully everyone else on the server if you're feeling mean! First, I'd start with a macerator and a generator so that I could duplicate ores.   
[Inventory Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/inventory-tweaks) is a mod that sorts your inventory when you press 'R' and sorts chest by pressing the buttons in the top of the chest. Nifty.  
[Iron Chest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iron-chests) adds chests made of various metals and also ways to upgrade already placed chests. Craft an iron chest with a chest surrounded by iron or an upgrade with wood planks surrouned by iron bars.  
[Lumy Skin Patch](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lumy-skin-patch) fixes skins for this version of minecraft. No gameplay changes, outside of skins not being broken anymore.  
[Mantle](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mantle) is a library mod required for Tinkers' Construct and Natura. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[MicdoodleCore](https://micdoodle8.com/) is a library mod required for Galacticraft. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
**[Mystcraft](http://wiki.mystcraft.xcompwiz.com/Main_Page) is so buggy, and it causes lag so much, but I love it. Based on the 1993 game *Myst*, Mystcraft provides ways to define your own dimensions, or ages, with books and teleport through the book to the new age. First, you'll need an ink mixer, a book binder, and a writing desk. Don't forget to make a way back.**
[Natura](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natura) is the lesser known companion ot Tinkers' Construct. It provides fun and nostalgic world generation features like different trees and berries!  
[NotEnoughItems](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughitems-gtnh) is an invaluable mod for searching recipies. In the bottom of the screen, search the name of the item, the name of the mod (using "@modName"), and some third thing that I can't think of right now. I'm using the GregTech: New Horizons version of this mod because it's better.  
[OpenEye](https://openeye.openmods.info/) is a mod that makes my job diagnosing the many, many crashes of this modpack easier. This mod does not have any gameplay changes, but does provide a button on the main menu at first launch and also when you crash.   
[Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) is a mod that makes Minecraft run less bad. Sometimes it breaks the graphics on certain computers. Be aware of that.   
[Pam's HarvestCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pams-harvestcraft) adds crops to find and grow and eat. Find some plants in the world to harvest, plant them, and see what you can craft out of them!  
[SpongeMixins Loader](https://modrinth.com/mod/spongemixin1710/) is a dependency mod required for some mod, I forget which one. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Storage Drawers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/storage-drawers) adds drawers! That you can store things in! I like to use it for my Botania flowers. There are thick and thin variants, and some can store just one type of item, but others can store 2 or 4. Craft them with chests, wood, and slabs in various arrangements.  
**[Thaumcraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thaumcraft) is a mod that allows you to research physical objects and then extract that magic to use to your own ends. Start by crafting an iron capped wand, and then right click a bookshelf with it. From here, I can no longer aid your descent into madness...**  
[Thermal Dynamics](https://teamcofh.com/) lets you transport 'flux' (energy created in other thermal mods) and any items.  
[Thermal Expansion](https://teamcofh.com/) adds flux (energy) generation and storage plus variuous fluid storage things.  
[Thermal Foundation](https://teamcofh.com/) adds the basic ores, metals, and materials for the other thermal mods.  
[Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) is a funky little mod that lets you make your tools of different component parts to give them different features! Start by reading *Materials and You: Volume 1* and begin your toolsmithing carrer!  
[Tropicraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tropicraft/) is a comfy tropical respite from normal minecraft. All you need is a Piña Colada, a beach chair, and a beautiful sunset. Ahh, that's nice.   
[The Twilight Forest](http://benimatic.com/tfwiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) Real talk, whenever anyone says "magical forest", this mod is what I think of. If you told me that Lillia League of Legends didn't come from this forest, I'd believe you but be sad about it. To get there, make a 2x2 puddle of water surrounded by dirt, with flowers on all the blocks of dirt that surround the water. Then throw in a diamond!  
[Xaero's Minimap](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap) puts a little minimap on your screen.  
[Xaero's World Map](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-world-map) adds a full screen map accessed by pressing 'M'.
