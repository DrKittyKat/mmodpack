# All Mods  
[AbyssalCraft](https://abyssalcraft.fandom.com/wiki/AbyssalCraft_Wiki) is an exploration mod that provides Lovecraftian dimensions and biomes. Start by crafting a Necronomicon with rotten flesh, iron, and a book.  
[Archaic Fix](https://github.com/embeddedt/ArchaicFix) is a bunch of bug fixes for 1.7.10. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Atum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atum) is a mod that makes a desert dimension based kinda on ancient Egypt stuff. You need to craft a scarab with gold and diamond and to build a portal with sandstone and water.  
[BetterFps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterfps) is a mod that makes the FPS(frames per second) better. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[BiblioCraft](https://www.bibliocraftmod.com/) adds lots of fun decorative, lighting, and storage thingies! Check NEI for recipies.  
[BiblioWoods](https://www.bibliocraftmod.com/bibliowoods-addons/) provides BiblioCraft integration for Biomes O' Plenty, ExtraBiomesXL, and Natura.  
[Biomes O' Plenty](https://biomesoplenty.fandom.com/wiki/Biomes_O%27_Plenty_Wiki) makes exploring more fun with more biomes! In addition to more biomes, there are more plants, tree types, and blocks. There is no biome finder in this version, so get exploring!  
[Blood Magic](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blood-magic) is a dark magic based off the blood of you and your enemies. To start, you're going to need to craft a blood altar with a diamond and gold and then use it to make a blood orb, but ~~the documentation for this old version of the mod no longer exists~~ the knowledge of this magic has been lost to time...  
**[Botania](https://botaniamod.net/index.html) is a magical science based off flowers. Start by putting a sapling and a book together and collecting the sixteen colors of mystical flowers!**  
[BuildCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/buildcraft) pipes and generators and machines oh my! There are also facades for basically every block, so good luck finding anything in NEI for it...  
[Chocolate Quest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cqrepoured) adds structures to discover when exploring and magic stuff I think. I only ever like exploring the structures, so I don't know all you can do with it!  
[CodeChicken Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/codechickencore) is a library mod required for NotEnoughItems. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[CoFH Core](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cofh-core) is a library mod required for Thermal Dynamics, Expansion, and Foundation. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[CoroUtil Library](https://coros.us/mods/coroutil) is a library mod required for TropiCraft. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Endless IDs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/endlessids) is a mod that provides fixes for biome and dimension ids as well as patches for some of the mods I used. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[Erebus](https://the-erebus.fandom.com/wiki/The_Erebus_Wiki) is a dimension with lots of bugs to meet and say hello to! Start by crafting an offering altar with stone bricks, obsidian, and gold. Then, offer an emerald, diamond, and obsidan. You may want to make two so you can make a staff to get there and a staff to get back. I don't like bugs very much, so I will not be spending much time here...  
**Eternal Frost (~~Good luck finding a link lol~~) is a snowy dimension, that I very much vibe with. This lost mod is only in 1.7.10! Start by crafting a flint and diamond then build a portal out of snowy obsidian. Are you ready to freeze to death in the frostfire?**  
[ExtrabiomesXL](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extrabiomesxl) is a 1.7.10 exclusive mod that includes lots of new biomes to explore! In my opinion, compared to Biomes O' Plenty, it's more impressive on a macro generation scale, but less interesting on a micro scale.  
[FalsePatternLib](https://github.com/FalsePattern/FalsePatternLib) is a library mod required for Endless IDs. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.  
[FastCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastcraft) makes Minecraft perform better, in general, like FPS increase, TPS improvements, RAM savings, and more. This mod does not have any gameplay changes.
